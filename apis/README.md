# APIs

This folder contains Python implementations for various API types and frameworks, including **GraphQL**, **gRPC**, **MQTT**, **REST APIs**, **SOAP**, and **WebSockets**. Each folder includes examples and code for setting up these APIs with popular Python libraries and frameworks.

## Contents

- [GraphQL](#graphql)
- [gRPC](#grpc)
- [MQTT](#mqtt)
- [REST APIs](#rest-apis)
- [SOAP](#soap)
- [WebSockets](#websockets)

### GraphQL

GraphQL APIs enable clients to request exactly the data they need, improving efficiency and flexibility.

- **Graphene with Django** (`graphene_django.py`): Example of setting up a GraphQL API using the Graphene library with Django.
- **Flask with Ariadne** (`flask_ariadne.py`): Example of using Ariadne with Flask for schema-first GraphQL development.

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Import and set up schema
# Refer to graphene_django.py or flask_ariadne.py for details.
```

### gRPC

gRPC is a high-performance, RPC framework that uses protocol buffers to serialize data and is suitable for microservices communication.

- **gRPC Python Client** (`grpc_python.py`): Python client for making gRPC calls.
- **Proto File** (`service.proto`): Defines the gRPC service and message structure.
- **Generated Code** (`service_pb2.py` and `service_pb2_grpc.py`): Generated from the proto file for server and client communication.

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Run `python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=. --grpc_python_out=. service.proto` to generate service_pb2.py files.
# See grpc_python.py for client usage.
```

### MQTT

MQTT is a lightweight messaging protocol often used in IoT applications for real-time communication.

- **MQTT Client Example** (`mqtt.py`): Demonstrates setting up an MQTT client to publish and subscribe to topics using the `paho-mqtt` library.

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Set up the MQTT client and connect to a broker.
# Refer to mqtt.py for detailed implementation.
```

### REST APIs

REST APIs are widely used for web services, providing easy access to resources over HTTP.

- **Django Rest Framework** (`django_rest.py`): Uses Django and DRF to set up a REST API.
- **Django Ninja** (`django_ninja_rest.py`): A fast alternative to DRF using Django Ninja with Python type hints.
- **Flask-RESTful** (`flask_rest.py`): REST API setup using Flask and Flask-RESTful.

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Configure views and endpoints as per the specific framework.
# See django_rest.py, django_ninja_rest.py, and flask_rest.py for setup.
```

---

### SOAP

SOAP is a protocol for web services that relies on XML and is often used in enterprise environments.

- **Zeep with Python** (`zeep_python.py`): Demonstrates making SOAP API calls using the `zeep` library for a simple client interface.

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Import zeep and configure a client using the WSDL URL.
# Refer to zeep_python.py for making calls to SOAP services.
```

---

### WebSockets

WebSockets provide real-time, two-way communication, often used in chat applications, live notifications, and streaming.

- **Django Channels** (`django_channels.py`): Uses Django Channels to handle WebSocket connections.
- **Flask-SocketIO** (`flask_sockets.py`): Implements WebSocket connections in Flask using Flask-SocketIO.

**Usage Example**:
```python
# Set up WebSocket consumers or event handlers for real-time communication.
# See django_channels.py and flask_sockets.py for specific implementations.
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `apis` folder.
2. Install any dependencies listed in each script.
3. Run the scripts to start the API server or client for each type.
4. Refer to each file for specific configuration and usage details.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If youâ€™d like to add more API types or enhance existing ones, please submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

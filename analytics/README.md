# Analytics

This folder contains Python implementations for integrating various analytics tools into backend applications. Each script provides functions to send events, track metrics, and monitor application usage using different analytics platforms.

## AWS CloudWatch

AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service from AWS that allows you to collect and track metrics, set alarms, and automatically respond to changes in AWS resources.

- **File**: `aws_cloudwatch_analytics.py`
- **Setup**:
  1. Install the AWS SDK: `pip install boto3`.
  2. Configure AWS credentials with access to CloudWatch.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from aws_cloudwatch_analytics import put_custom_metric
  put_custom_metric("MyAppNamespace", "UserLogins", 1)
  ```

## Azure Monitor

Azure Monitor provides full-stack monitoring for applications, infrastructure, and network. It includes features like metrics tracking, alerting, and visualization.

- **File**: `azure_monitor_analytics.py`
- **Setup**:
  1. Install Azure SDK: `pip install azure-monitor-query azure-identity`.
  2. Configure Azure credentials (client ID, tenant ID, and client secret) for authentication.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from azure_monitor_analytics import query_metrics
  query_metrics("<resource_id>")
  ```

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics allows you to track website and application usage using events, page views, and other metrics through the Measurement Protocol.

- **File**: `google_analytics.py`
- **Setup**:
  1. No additional installation required, but you’ll need a Google Analytics tracking ID.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from google_analytics import send_event
  send_event("category", "action", "label", 10)
  ```

## Mixpanel

Mixpanel is an advanced analytics tool focused on tracking user interactions and product usage to provide insights into how users engage with your application.

- **File**: `mixpanel_analytics.py`
- **Setup**:
  1. Install the Mixpanel client: `pip install mixpanel`.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from mixpanel_analytics import track_event
  track_event("UserSignUp", "user_123", {"plan": "premium"})
  ```

## Sentry

Sentry is primarily an error tracking tool, but it also provides application performance monitoring. It’s ideal for capturing and reporting exceptions in real-time.

- **File**: `sentry_analytics.py`
- **Setup**:
  1. Install the Sentry SDK: `pip install sentry-sdk`.
  2. Initialize Sentry with your project’s DSN.

- **Example Usage**:
  ```python
  from sentry_analytics import log_error
  log_error()
  ```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `analytics` folder.
2. Install any required dependencies as mentioned in each section.
3. Configure your credentials for each service (e.g., AWS access keys, Google Analytics tracking ID).
4. Run the scripts to integrate analytics tracking into your application.
